# renovate-config

Default renovatebot config to be used across my repos.

Technically, this isn't a "package"; however, it's still a separate part of a monorepo, and thus, I stashed it under `packages/`.

You can see the actual config in `default.json` (a relic from the past, when this was its separate repository). You can point to it in the same way as the top-level `renovate.json` in this very repository.
